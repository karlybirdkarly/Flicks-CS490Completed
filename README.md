Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [X] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] When user clicks on the movie, they will see a detailed view for them which gives an expanded poster, name, rating, lsit of countries involved in production, genres of a movie, duration, and a description.
- [X] For a poster view I added the pod, APPArallaxHeader, which grows as user scrolls down which looks presentable with high quality images.
